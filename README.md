Trochilidae (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummingbird) is the family name of hummingbirds. The hummingbird unlike any other bird can fly backwards; similarly, this library allows you to fly backwards by providing backwards compatibility and wrappers around components of existing backwards compatibility libraries like future and six. Trochilidae at this point supports cross version reduce, and lazily evaluated filter.
